**Introduction to Machine Learning in Production**

This repository contains a collection of code, quizzes, and lectures from the "Introduction to Machine Learning in Production" course by Deeplearning.ai.

**Course Overview**

This course provides an introduction to the concepts and techniques of machine learning in production. Students learn how to deploy machine learning models in a production environment, including data preprocessing, model selection, hyperparameter tuning, and model serving.


**Prerequisites**

* Basic knowledge of machine learning concepts and techniques
* Familiarity with Python and relevant libraries (e.g. TensorFlow, scikit-learn)
* Experience with data preprocessing and feature engineering
